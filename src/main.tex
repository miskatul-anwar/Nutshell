\section{Permutations \& Combinations}
\textbf{Problems Related to Counting}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Consider the word "Permutation". In how many ways can you arrange the letters,\\
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item \textbf{No, rule specified,}\\
		            \[
			            Answer: \space n_t=2
		            \]
		            \[
			            \frac{11!}{2!}
		            \]
		      \item \textbf{If, The vowels stay together,\\}
		            \[
			            n_{total} = 7
		            \]
		            \[
			            n_t=2\\
		            \]
		            \[
			            The \space Answer:\space \frac{7!}{2!}\cdot 5!
		            \]
		      \item \textbf{If, The vowels don't stay together,\\}
		            \[
			            \frac{11!}{2!}-\frac{7!}{2!}\cdot 5!
		            \]
		      \item \textbf{If the vowels stay at their place,}\\
		            \[
			            \frac{6!}{2!}
		            \]
		      \item \textbf{If, The order (vowels) is same,}\\
		            "euaio" if the order of the vowels. Let's consider them as a single word.
		            \[
			            \frac{11!}{2!5!}
		            \]
		      \item \textbf{If the relative order is the same,}\\
		            \[
			            \frac{6!}{2!}\cdot 5!
		            \]
	      \end{itemize}
	\item How many numbers greater than 800 and less than 4000 can be made with the digits 0,1,2,4,5,7,8,9 ? (no number occuring more than once in the same number)\\
	      \textit{ Sol. }
	      firstly, let's consider the 801 - 999 range...(all the three digit numbers available in the limit)\\
	      The first number will definitely be 8 or 9, so the possible ways to put the first number is 2. The other numbers will be put as follows.
	      \[
		      2 \cdot 7 \cdot 6
	      \]
	      secondly, consider the 1000 - 3999 range...(all the four digit numbers available in the limit)\\
	      The first number can only be 1 or 2 as three  is not given. So, the rest will be declining in the previously shown manner.
	      \[
		      2 \cdot 7\cdot 6\cdot 5
	      \]
	      Now, calculation of the possible ways is as follows:
	      \[
		      2 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 + 2 \cdot 7\cdot 6\cdot 5 = 504
	      \]
	\item Your Home to DU there's 3 ways avalable to go. DU to BUET there's only 2 available ways. How many ways are there to visit BUET from your home?\\
	      (Yeah, ugh\dots you have'nt got a chance to read in BUET)\\
	      \textit{ Sol=> } There are 6 different ways to visit BUET from your home.
	\item there are five people in a vehicle. But there is only three sits available. In how many ways we can pick 3 people to have their sits?\\
	      \textit{ Sol.=> } The answer is:
	      \[
		      5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 60
	      \]
	      If we apply the formulae,
	      pick 3 people from 5 and arrange them.
	      \[
		      ^5P_3 = 60
	      \]
	\item How many even numbers of three digits can be formed from the digits 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 ?\\
	      \textit{ Sol.1} If the last digit is 0, 2, 4 or 6 , then it can be an even number. Also, we need to keep in mind that
	      the first number can't be zero.
	      \[
		      6 \cdot 5 \cdot 1 + 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 3 = 105
	      \]
	\item  The following problems have to do with cardinalities of sets
	      of phone numbers of certain kinds.
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item How many 7-digit phone numbers are possible, assuming
		            that the first digit can’t be a 0 or a 1?\\
		            \textit{ Sol. }\\
		            To determine the number of possible 7-digit phone numbers where the first digit cannot be 0 or 1, we can break the problem into parts:\\
		            \begin{itemize}
			            \item First Digit: The first digit has 8 possible choices (2 through 9).
			            \item Remaining Digits: Each of the remaining 6 digits can be any digit from 0 to 9, giving each position 10 possible choices.
		            \end{itemize}

		            Therefore, the total number of 7-digit phone numbers can be calculated as follows:\\
		            \[
			            8 \cdot 10^6
		            \]

		            Here's the step-by-step calculation:\\
		            There are 8 choices for the first digit.
		            There are 10 choices for each of the remaining 6 digits.
		            So, multiplying these together:
		            \[
			            8\cdot10^6=8,000,000
		            \]

		            Thus, there are 8,000,000 possible 7-digit phone numbers under the given constraints.
		      \item  Solve the above problem again, except now assume also that
		            the phone number is not allowed to start with 911 (since
		            this is reserved for emergency use, and it would not be
		            desirable for the system to wait to see whether more digits
		            were going to be dialed after someone has dialed 911).
		            \textit{ Sol. }\\
		            To solve this problem under the new constraints, we need to calculate the total number of valid 7-digit phone numbers that do not start with 911.\\
		            \textbf{Steps:}
		            \begin{enumerate}
			            \item Total number of 7-digit phone numbers without additional constraints:
			                  As previously calculated, the total number of possible 7-digit phone numbers where the first digit can't be 0 or 1 is:
			                  \[
				                  8×10^6
				                  =8,000,000
			                  \]
			            \item Calculate the number of invalid phone numbers that start with 911:
			                  \begin{itemize}
				                  \item If the phone number starts with 911, the first three digits are fixed as 911.
				                  \item The remaining 4 digits can each be any digit from 0 to 9, so there are
				                        10 choices for each of the remaining 4 digits.
			                  \end{itemize}
			                  Therefore, the number of phone numbers that start with 911 is:
			                  \[
				                  10
				                  ×
				                  10
				                  ×
				                  10
				                  ×
				                  10
				                  =
				                  1
				                  0
				                  ^4
				                  =
				                  10
				                  ,
				                  000
			                  \]

		            \end{enumerate}
		      \item Subtract the number of invalid phone numbers from the total:\\

		            Total valid phone numbers = Total possible phone numbers - Invalid phone numbers.\\
		            \[
			            8,000,000−10,000=7,990,000
		            \]
	      \end{itemize}
	      Thus, the total number of valid 7-digit phone numbers, ensuring the first digit can't be 0 or 1 and the number does not start with 911, is 7,990,000.
	\item How many different functions f : A → B are possible in total
	      with |A| = m and |B| = n? (m and n are, of course, positive
	      integers.)\\
	      \textit{ Sol.2}\\

	      To determine how many different functions
	      f:A→B are possible with
	      ∣A∣=m and ∣B∣=n, we can consider the following:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item
		            Definition of a Function: A function
		            \[
			            f:A\rightarrow B
		            \] maps every element in set
		            A to an element in set
		            B.
		      \item
		            Total Number of Functions:

		            For each element in set
		            A, there are
		            n possible choices in set
		            B.
		            Since there are
		            m elements in set
		            A, each of the
		            m elements can independently be mapped to any of the
		            n elements in
		            B.

	      \end{itemize}

	      To find the total number of such functions, we use the principle of counting:
	      \[
		      n×n×n×⋯×n(m times)
	      \]

	      This can be written as:
	      \[
		      n^m
	      \]
	      Conclusion
	      Thus, the total number of different functions
	      f:A→B with
	      ∣A∣=m and
	      ∣B∣=n is
	      \[
		      n^m
	      \]
	\item
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item  Consider the grid shown below. Starting at a point, you can
		            go one step up or one step to the right at each move (as long
		            as any such move keeps you within the grid). This procedure
		            is continued until the point C is reached from point A.\\
		            (a) How many different paths are there from A to C?\\
		            (b) How many different paths from A to C pass through B?\\
		            \begin{tikzpicture}
			            % Grid lines
			            \draw[step=1cm,gray,very thin] (0,0) grid (6,5);

			            % Points A, B, C
			            \filldraw[blue] (0,0) circle (3pt) node[anchor=north east] {A};
			            \filldraw[blue] (3,3) circle (3pt) node[anchor=south east] {B};
			            \filldraw[blue] (6,5) circle (3pt) node[anchor=south east] {C};

			            % Labels for grid points
			            \foreach \x in {1,...,6} {
					            \foreach \y in {1,...,5} {
							            \node at (\x-0.5,\y-0.5) {(\x,\y)};
						            }
				            }\end{tikzpicture}\\
		            (We say that two paths are different whenever they are not
		            identical.)\\

		            Let's analyze the problem of finding different paths in a 5x6 grid from point A to point C, and specifically how many of those paths pass through point B(2,3).
		            In a 5x6 grid:\\
		            Starting from point A(1,1) to point C(5,6), you need to make 4 steps up and 5 steps to the right.
		            The total number of paths from A to C can be calculated using the combination formula, since each path consists of 4 up movements (U) and 5 right movements (R):
		            \[
			            Total Paths = 9C4
		            \]
		            Calculating this:
		            \[
			            \frac{4×3×2×1}{9×8×7×6} =126
		            \]
		            So, there are 126 different paths from A to C in the grid.
		      \item
		            To find paths from A to C that pass through B(2,3):

		            From A to B(2,3), you need 1 step up and 2 steps to the right.
		            From B(2,3) to C(5,6), you need 3 steps up and 3 steps to the right.
		            So, the paths from A to C passing through B(2,3) involve:\\

		            1 step up from A to B,\\
		            2 steps to the right from A to B,\\
		            3 steps up from B to C, and\\
		            3 steps to the right from B to C.\\
		            This gives a total of:
		            \[
			            3C1 \cdot 5C2 = 30
		            \]
		            \begin{itemize}
			            \item  There are 126 different paths from A to C.
			            \item There are 30 different paths from A to C that pass through B(2,3).
		            \end{itemize}

	\item As a part of the population in Silverland seeks to break free,
	      higher ups of the mafia enterprise that controls Silverland has
	      decided to quickly form a regional subcommittee with their
	      operatives to teach them a lesson. The subcommittee is to
	      consist of 3 hockeystick experts (H), 2 tech-savvy social media
	      monitors (S), and 2 specializing in effective usage of machete
	      (M). When a pool of 8 H, 3 S, and 6 M among their regular

		            Number of ways where the 2 H do not serve together:

		            Number of ways where the 2 M do not serve together:

		            \[ \binom{8}{3} \times \binom{2}{1} \times \binom{5}{1} \times \binom{5}{2} \]

		            Number of ways where 1 S and 1 M do not serve together:

\section{Encapsulation}
Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that binds together the data (variables) and the methods (functions)
that manipulate that data within a single unit, such as a class or module. This unit is designed to hide its internal details from the outside
world while exposing only necessary information through a controlled interface.\\
Why Encapsulation ?
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Data Hiding}: Encapsulation helps to hide the implementation details of an object from the outside world, making it difficult for other parts of the program to access or modify the data directly.

	\item \textbf{Abstraction}: It provides abstraction by showing only the necessary information to the outside world while hiding the internal implementation details.

	\item \textbf{Code Organization}: Encapsulation promotes good code organization and structure by grouping related data and methods together.
\end{enumerate}
Ways to do that...
\begin{itemize}
	\item Java Packages
	\item Access Modifiers
	\item Java Encapsulation
	\item Data Hiding
	\item The `static` keyword
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Java Packages}
A package is simply a container that groups related types (Java classes, interfaces, enumerations, and annotations)
An example package:
\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{../pngs/package.png}
	\caption{Linux Console}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Access Modifiers}
In Java, access modifiers are keywords that determine the visibility of a class, method, or variable to other parts of your program. They control
who can see or interact with these elements.
\begin{itemize}

	\item \textbf{public}: Accessible from anywhere in your program.
	\item \textbf{private}: Only accessible within the same class.
	\item \textbf{protected}: Accessible only within the same class and its subclasses.
	\item \textbf{default} (or no modifier): Accessible only within the same package.
\end{itemize}
Let's consider a simple example with a class `Car`:
\begin{minted}[frame=single,linenos,breaklines]{java}
 public class Car {
    // public variable
    public String color = "red";

    // private method
    private void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Vroom!");
    }

    // protected constructor
    protected Car(String make, String model) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
    }
}  
\end{minted}
\subsubsection{public}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use public classes when you want to expose a class or interface to the outside world.
	\item Examples:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item  A web service API that needs to be accessed by clients.
		      \item  A utility class that provides common functionality.
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{minted}[frame=single,linenos,breaklines]{java}
 public class MathUtils {
    public static int sum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}  
\end{minted}
\subsubsection{private}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use private variables or methods when you want to hide internal implementation details from the outside world.
	\item Examples:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item A `Car` class might have a private `startEngine()` method that's not meant to be called directly by other classes.
		      \item An immutable class might have private setters and getters.
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ways to Encapsulation}
\subsubsection{Simple Class}
A basic Java class that encapsulates a private integer variable \texttt{x} and provides a public method \texttt{getValue()} to retrieve its value:

\begin{minted}[frame=single,linenos,breaklines]{java}
public class SimpleClass {
    private int x;

    public SimpleClass(int x) {
        this.x = x;
    }

    public int getValue() {
        return x;
    }
}
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{Bank Account}
A Java class that encapsulates a bank account, with private fields for balance and account number, and public methods to deposit, withdraw, and get the balance:

\begin{minted}[frame=single,linenos,breaklines]{java}
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;
    private int accountNumber;

    public BankAccount(int accountNumber) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = 0.0;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient funds!");
        }
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{Student Record}
A Java class that encapsulates a student's record, with private fields for name, age, and grades, and public methods to set and retrieve the information:

\begin{minted}[frame=single,linenos,breaklines]{java}
public class StudentRecord {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private double[] grades;

    public StudentRecord(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.grades = new double[5];
    }

    public void setGrade(int index, double grade) {
        grades[index] = grade;
    }

    public double getAverageGrade() {
        double sum = 0.0;
        for (double grade : grades) {
            sum += grade;
        }
        return sum / grades.length;
    }
}
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{Use Cases}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Security}: Encapsulation ensures that sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access.
	\item \textbf{Code Reusability}: By encapsulating related data and methods, you can reuse the code in different parts of your program.
	\item \textbf{Improved Code Organization}: Encapsulation helps to organize your code in a logical and structured way.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Applications}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Database Management Systems}: Database management systems like MySQL or Oracle use encapsulation to hide their internal implementation details while providing a controlled interface for data manipulation.
	\item \textbf{Financial Applications}: Banking and financial applications, such as accounting software, use encapsulation to protect sensitive customer data and ensure secure transactions.
	\item \textbf{Gaming}: Games often use encapsulation to hide the internal workings of game mechanics, levels, or characters, making it easier to modify or extend the game without affecting other parts.
\end{enumerate}

In summary, encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that helps to organize code, protect sensitive data, and improve code reusability.
\subsection{Data Hiding}
Data hiding is a principle of encapsulation that conceals the internal representation of an object's state (data) from external objects, making it difficult for other parts of the program to access or modify the data directly. This helps to:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Prevent Accidental Changes}: By hiding the internal state, you prevent accidental changes to the data from outside the class.
	\item \textbf{Control Access}: You can control access to the data by providing methods (getters and setters) that allow only authorized objects to modify the data.
	\item \textbf{Improve Code Quality}: Data hiding encourages good coding practices, such as using meaningful variable names and encapsulating related data.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{How to Apply Data Hiding}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Make Data Private}: Declare the data variables as private within the class:
	      \begin{minted}[frame=single,linenos,breaklines]{java}
    public class Example {
        private int x;
        // ...
    }
    \end{minted}

	\item \textbf{Use Getters and Setters}: Provide public methods (getters and setters) that allow controlled access to the data:
	      \begin{minted}[frame=single,linenos,breaklines]{java}
    public class Example {
        private int x;

        public int getX() {
            return x;
        }

        public void setX(int value) {
            x = value; // validate or transform the value if needed
        }
    }
    \end{minted}

	\item \textbf{Avoid Direct Access}: Refrain from accessing the data directly from outside the class:
	      \begin{minted}[frame=single,linenos,breaklines]{java}
    public class Example {
        private int x;

        public void someMethod() {
            System.out.println(x); // bad practice, avoid direct access
        }
    }
    \end{minted}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Best Practices}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Use Meaningful Variable Names}: Use descriptive names for your variables to make the code more readable.
	\item \textbf{Limit Access Modifiers}: Limit access modifiers (public, private, protected) to only what's necessary.
	\item \textbf{Validate Input}: Validate input data before modifying it to ensure integrity and prevent errors.
	\item \textbf{Use Immutable Objects}: Consider using immutable objects when possible, especially for sensitive or critical data.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Real-World Examples}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Bank Account}: A bank account class should hide its internal balance and only provide methods for depositing, withdrawing, and getting the balance.
	\item \textbf{Person Information}: A person information class might hide their personal details (name, age, address) and provide getter methods to access this information.
\end{enumerate}

By applying data hiding principles, you can create more robust, maintainable, and secure code that is easier to understand and modify over time.
\subsection{The `static` keyword}

The `static` keyword in Java is used to declare static variables or methods that belong to a class rather than an instance of the class. Here are
some key uses of the `static` keyword:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  \textbf{Static Variables:} You can use `static` variables to store values that don't change throughout the program's execution.
	      \begin{minted}[frame=single,linenos,breaklines]{java}

       public class MyMath {
    public static int MAX_VALUE = 100;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(MyMath.MAX_VALUE); // prints 100
    }
  }
    \end{minted}
	\item  \textbf{Static Methods:} You can use `static` methods to perform operations that don't depend on instance-specific data.
	      \begin{minted}[frame=single,linenos,breaklines]{java}
       
public class MathUtil {
    public static double sqrt(double num) {
        return Math.sqrt(num);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(MathUtil.sqrt(4)); // prints 2.0
    }
}
    \end{minted}
	\item\textbf{Singleton Pattern: }You can use `static` variables to implement the Singleton pattern, where only one instance of a class exists throughout
	      the program's execution.
	      \begin{minted}[frame=single,linenos,breaklines]{java}
           public class Logger {
    private static Logger instance = null;

    public static Logger getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Logger();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    // ...
}
        \end{minted}
	      In this example, the `Logger` class uses a `static` variable to keep track of the single instance.
	\item \textbf{Utility Methods: } You can use `static` methods as utility methods that can be called from anywhere in your code without creating an instance
	      of the class.

	      Example:
	      \begin{minted}[frame=single,linenos,breaklines]{java}
 public class StringHelper {
    public static boolean isEmpty(String str) {
        return str == null || str.trim().length() == 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(StringHelper.isEmpty("")); // prints true
        System.out.println(StringHelper.isEmpty("hello")); // prints false
    }
}          
        \end{minted}
	      In this example, the `isEmpty` method is a `static` utility method that can be called from anywhere in your code.

	      These are just a few examples of how you can use the `static` keyword in Java. Remember to use it wisely and only when necessary!
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{File Handling}

\textbf{Copying Contents from \texttt{INPUT.DAT} to \texttt{OUTPUT.DAT}}

\begin{minted}[frame=single,linenos,breaklines]{java}
public class copyPaste {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("input.dat"));
        String str;
        if ((str = br.readLine()) != null) {
            System.out.println(str);
        }
        br.close();
        BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("output.dat"));
        bw.append(str);
        bw.close();
        return;
    }
}
\end{minted}

\textbf{Using \texttt{DataOutputStream} and \texttt{DataInputStream}}

\begin{minted}[frame=single,linenos,breaklines]{java}
import java.io.*;

public class file1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream("Test.txt");
        DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(fout);
        out.writeDouble(98.6);
        out.writeInt(1000);
        out.writeBoolean(true);
        out.close();
        
        FileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream("Test.txt");
        DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(fin);
        double d = in.readDouble();
        int i = in.readInt();
        boolean b = in.readBoolean();
        System.out.println("Here are the values: " + d + " " + i + " " + b);
        in.close();
    }
}
\end{minted}

\textbf{Reading from \texttt{output.txt}}

\begin{minted}[frame=single,linenos,breaklines]{java}
import java.io.*;

public class file3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("output.txt"));
        String str;
        if ((str = br.readLine()) != null) {
            System.out.println(str);
        }
        br.close();
        return;
    }
}
\end{minted}


\subsection{\texttt{final} keyword in Java}

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|l|p{10cm}|}
		\hline
		\textbf{Type}  & \textbf{Description}                                                                                                                                                 \\
		\hline
		Final Variable & Variable with `final` keyword cannot be assigned again, similar to `const` in C. Once initialized, its value cannot be changed.                                      \\
		\hline
		Final Method   & Method with `final` keyword cannot be overridden by its subclasses. This ensures that the method's implementation in the superclass cannot be changed by subclasses. \\
		\hline
		Final Class    & Class with `final` keyword cannot be extended or inherited from. It serves as a final implementation that cannot be subclassed.                                      \\
		\hline

\subsection{Java Inheritance}

\textbf{01 (Method Overriding)}

\begin{minted}[frame=single,linenos,breaklines]{java}
// Parent class (Shape)
class Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a shape");
    }
}

// Child class (Circle) that extends the parent class (Shape)
class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

// Child class (Rectangle) that extends the parent class (Shape)

        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle();

        // Use polymorphism to call the draw method on these objects
        Shape shape1 = circle;
        Shape shape2 = rectangle;

        shape1.draw();  // Output: Drawing a circle

// Child class (Car) that extends the parent class (Vehicle)
class Car extends Vehicle {
    void accelerate() {
        System.out.println("Accelerating a car");
    }
}

// Child class (Motorcycle) that extends the parent class (Vehicle)
class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {
    void revEngine() {
        System.out.println("Revving a motorcycle engine");
    }
}

public class InheritanceExample2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create objects of the child classes
        Car car = new Car();
        Motorcycle motorcycle = new Motorcycle();

        // Use polymorphism to call the start method on these objects
        Vehicle vehicle1 = car;
        Vehicle vehicle2 = motorcycle;

        vehicle1.start();  // Output: Starting a vehicle
        vehicle2.start();  // Output: Starting a vehicle
    }
}
\end{minted}


\subsubsection{Using \texttt{super} keyword in Inheritance}

\begin{minted}[frame=single,linenos,breaklines]{java}
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("The animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        super.sound();
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}

public class SuperKeywordExample {

public class ThisKeywordExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Complex num1 = new Complex(11, 15);
        Complex num2 = new Complex(11, 15);
        num1.print();

		\hline
		\texttt{this} is an implicit reference variable used to represent the current class. It can invoke methods of the current class and refer to its instance and static variables. It's also used to return and pass as an argument in the context of a current class object. & \texttt{super} is an implicit reference variable used to represent the immediate parent class. It can invoke methods of the immediate parent class, refer to its instance and static variables, and invoke its constructor. \\
